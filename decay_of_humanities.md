This read-me file was written when we had decided to investigate if, and if so: when, a 'decay of the humanities' had taken place, or was at least mentioned in the newspaper. This would then form a starting point to a later interpretation of the data. However, since we decided in the end to leave out the interpretation due to the fact that our data is still much to raw for such a process, this document was placed in the 'unused scripts' section of the project.

Decay of humanities

In table 1 we see two lesser periods in the humanities. The first one started in 1970 and the second one in 2009. We shall explain the reasons for these periods.

teble 1: coming

1970

In the article The real reason the humanities ‘are in crisis’ they conclude that the drop in humanities has to deal with the interest of women in humanities. In 1950 the percentage of men was 7% in humanities. In the late 1960’s more than 20% percent of the women was in humanities. The percentage of women has dropped to below 10% in the 1980’s while the percentage of men was the same.
In 1980 the women started exploring different fields like business, engineering, and communication. This wasn’t the case in the 1960’s/1970’s.

2014 Since a few years there is less interest in humanities. We have seen this development of less humanities students in table 1. There are some reasons for this decrease.
In comparison with other high post graduation the unemployment rate is high. Furthermore humanities graduates have lower startsalaries.
